Why clear_history function in subject ? (Not needed apparently)
Check for commands before executing them : echo hello | notexist -d l  --> notexist command not found
Fix command > file1 > file 2. (need to create file1, but write result in the last one)
Fix extra newline in prompt. (you add it for fix ctrl^c i think)

Anton: my bash do nothing in the case when cd with no args, owr print a promp
	--> That's ok we don't have to handle that

Anton: unset dont working for me :( . if "unset $PATH" do nothing, -> this is normal
		if "unset PATH" and then try to execut any command, we got segfault(maybe wrong node deleting)

Anton: test in built-ins ft_strcmp possible error. In unset.c for example. You are cheking arg len caracters, possible error is "unset test" will work for $test123 if $test not existing
--> Did I fix that last time ?

input/output file without permissons

./file_withous_permission message

Anton
============
Handle input (done)
Parsing Errors (in progress)
Here-doc mode (normally done)
Test behaviour when no env (normally done)
Fixed and tested many return values for errors, can be checked by echo $?
Fixed cases like "ls >|" "ls |||>" ">" "<" etc.
Fixed some input bugs
Added t_strlist->int ret variable to easily update the last returned value
Added some preprocessor define for economise lines
Fixed many of valgrind errors and no memory leaks were detected


Tom
===========

Signal handling : Prompt still not ok --> Launch cat and ctrl+\
Prompt hack overwriting output is a BAD idea

Check for multiple redir such as <<< of ||

Implement all built ins :
	echo : done
	pwd : done
	cd :
	export : check if valid  input after = ? Check for valid identifiers
			export LOL=lol ?HELLO=hello does not work
	unset : check for valid identifier
	exit : done
	env : done

Print no such file or directory if command contains a "/"
test "" "" ""
test 
env -i ./minishell
then
export LOL=lolbash
then
bash
