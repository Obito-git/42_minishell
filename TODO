Expansion
Test behaviour when no env
Why clear_history function in subject?
Look at the readline functions
Check for commands before executing them : echo hello | notexist -d l  --> notexist command not found
Redirect ouput for built-ins : echo hello > hello.txt --> no output
Why minishell prints "exit" on Ctrl+D ?
If there's just one command, no forking because built-ins do not have lasting effect whem piped but do on their own

Signal handling

Implement all built ins :
	echo : done
	pwd : done
	cd :
	export : 
	unset
	exit : What about history ?
	env :
(Do we need to copy env and carry our own copy around ?)

Replace printf with dprintf -> STDERR

Pipeline returns last pid : should work

If necessary maybe make a t_cmd_list struct {
	t_command *head;
	t_command *curr_cmd;
	int		remaining;
}
