Why clear_history function in subject ? (Not needed apparently)
Check for commands before executing them : echo hello | notexist -d l  --> notexist command not found
Fix command > file1 > file 2. (need to create file1, but write result in the last one)
Fix extra newline in prompt. (you add it for fix ctrl^c i think)

Anton: my bash do nothing in the case when cd with no args, owr print a promp
	--> That's ok we don't have to handle that

Anton: unset dont working for me :( . if "unset $PATH" do nothing, 
		if "unset PATH" and then try to execut any command, we got segfault(maybe wrong node deleting)

Anton: test in built-ins ft_strcmp possible error. In unset.c for example. You are cheking arg len caracters, possible error is "unset test" will work for $test123 if $test not existing
--> Did I fix that last time ?

input/output file without permissons

./file_withous_permission message

Anton
============
Handle input (done)
Parsing Errors (in progress)
Here-doc mode (normally done)
Test behaviour when no env (normally done)
Fixed and tested many return values for errors, can be checked by echo $?
Fixed cases like "ls >|" "ls |||>" ">" "<" etc.
Fixed some input bugs
Added t_strlist->int ret variable to easily update the last returned value
Added some preprocessor define for economise lines
Fixed many of valgrind errors and no memory leaks were detected


Tom
===========
Expansion :stop handling of special variables

Check returning of NULL and freeing everything in case of expansion errors

Signal handling : Prompt still not ok --> Launch cat and ctrl+\

Implement ft_strndup and remove strndup --> DONE

check for redir symbol at beginning of the output (may not work)

Implement all built ins :
	echo : done
	pwd : done
	cd :
	export : check if valid  input after = ?
	unset : done
	exit : What about history ?
	env : done

Replace printf with dprintf -> Done

Pipeline returns last pid : ?

If there's just one command, no forking because built-ins do not have lasting 
effect whem piped but do on their own. Still OK ?
