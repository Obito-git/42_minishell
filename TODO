Fix command > file1 > file 2. (need to create file1, but write result in the last one)
Fix extra newline in prompt. (you add it for fix ctrl^c i think)

Anton: my bash do nothing in the case when cd with no args, owr print a promp
	--> That's ok we don't have to handle that

Anton: unset dont working for me :( . if "unset $PATH" do nothing, -> this is normal
		if "unset PATH" and then try to execut any command, we got segfault(maybe wrong node deleting)

Anton: test in built-ins ft_strcmp possible error. In unset.c for example. You are cheking arg len caracters, possible error is "unset test" will work for $test123 if $test not existing
--> Did I fix that last time ?
